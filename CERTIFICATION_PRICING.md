# PiQrypt — Certification Service

**Independent third-party certification for PiQrypt audit bundles.**

PiQrypt memory is verifiable locally without any external service.
Certification is an optional step — for contexts where independent,
third-party attestation is required.

---

## What certification adds

Local verification confirms that your audit chain is intact.

Certification adds:

- An independent signature from PiQrypt certification authority
- A verifiable timestamp from a trusted third-party TSA (RFC 3161)
- A portable certified bundle — verifiable by anyone, anywhere
- No dependency on your infrastructure for future verification

The certified bundle can be submitted to regulators, courts,
auditors, or counterparties without sharing any original content.

---

## What is never shared

Certification operates on hashes only.

- Raw agent outputs are never transmitted
- Prompt content is never shared
- Decision payloads are never exposed
- Only the cryptographic structure of your audit chain is processed

This makes certification compatible with GDPR, HIPAA,
and other data minimization requirements.

## How it works

```
1. Export your audit chain locally
   piqrypt export audit.json

2. Submit at checkout
   No content shared — hashes only

3. Receive certified bundle by email
   In under 5 minutes

4. Verify anytime, anywhere
   piqrypt certify-verify bundle.piqrypt-certified
   ✅ Certified by PiQrypt CA
```

No integration required. Works with any existing PiQrypt audit chain.
Works without PiQrypt installed — share the bundle directly with auditors.

## Who is this for?

### Independent developer / creator

You need to prove that a piece of work existed before a given date.

A Simple or Timestamp certification provides a portable,
independently verifiable proof of prior existence —
without storing any content.

Relevant for: IP disputes · freelance contracts · content authorship

---

### AI SaaS company

A client disputes a recommendation your system made.
A regulator requests evidence of system behavior.

A Timestamp certification provides a court-admissible,
independently verified record of your agent's audit chain
at the time of the disputed event.

Relevant for: legal-tech · fintech · health-tech · HR automation

---

### Compliance officer / legal team

Your organization needs to demonstrate AI system integrity
to a regulator, auditor, or counterparty.

PiQrypt certification provides a portable bundle
that can be submitted without sharing any underlying data.

Relevant for: AI Act compliance · GDPR Article 22 · SEC recordkeeping
· ISO 27001 audit support · contractual due diligence

---

### Long-term archival

You need proof that will remain valid regardless of
future developments in computing — including quantum.

Post-Quantum certification uses Dilithium3 (NIST FIPS 204)
to produce signatures that remain computationally secure
for the foreseeable future.

Relevant for: medical records · industrial certifications
· financial archives · critical IP · government systems
